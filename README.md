VSCode extension to support tslint. This README describes the development setup, for information about the published extension refer to the [README](tslint/README.md) in the tslint folder.

## Development setup
- run npm install inside the `tslint` and `tslint-server` folders
- open VS Code on `tslint` and `tslint-server` or open a workspace with the client and server by opening `vscode-tslint.code-workspace` 
- compile the server once (see developing the server)

## Developing the server
- open VS Code on `tslint-server`
- run `npm run compile` or `npm run watch` to build the server and copy it into the `tslint` folder
- to debug press F5 which attaches a debugger to the server
- to trace the server communication you can enable the setting: "tslint.trace.server": "verbose", "messages"

## Developing the extension/client
- open VS Code on `tslint`
- run F5 to build and debug the extension

> If you want to debug server and extension at the same time; 1st debug extension and then start server debugging after you have opened a typescript file that activates the extension.

## Manual Tests
Manual tests can be found in the `tslint-tests` folder.  // test
